# ðŸ““ Purpose

![](../.gitbook/assets/Gold\_Dabloon3.png)

### Purpose&#x20;

The Galleon DAO is controlled by DOUBLOON token holders who participate in voting on off-chain proposals that impact governance within the Galleon product ecosystem. Governance Unlike commonly used governance voting models that can be cumbersome and slow, Galleon aims to be a fast-paced, aggressive and governance streamlined DAO.&#x20;

The mechanism that enables this is a novel approach to governance where development and initiatives are not voted in favour to continue, but voted to cease - this is called **Optimistic Governance**. This allows Galleon to execute new products efficiently and bring strategies to users at a pace that aligns with the rapidly changing market, avoiding no issue of missing governance quorum.&#x20;
