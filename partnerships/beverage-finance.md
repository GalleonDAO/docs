### **Partnership Details**

**Beverage &** **Galleon** joining forces not only makes complete sense from a thematic view but most importantly, both DAOs are aligned down to the roots in moving fast to create best-in-class structured products in a relatively unexplored ecosystem poised to significantly grow.

#### **Why Beverage & Galleon?**

‚öìÔ∏è **Galleons** core directive is to be the fastest vessel on the sea, exploring and **shipping novel structured products** within the Set ecosystem independently or with great methodologists as we identify what the different capital pools in the market are attracted to. Furthermore, when **Product-Market-Fit** is found, doubling down on them with incentivisation schemes and implementing growth loops within a DAO owned distribution platform, **SetSwap**.

üçπ **Beverage** is a DAO focused on researching, designing and building **complex leveraged products** utilising Set Protocol infrastructure, also sharing the core values of Galleon in shipping fast, experimenting, exploring and saturating the structured products space. The team behind Beverage have already proven their **technical expertise** in their product launches on Ethereum & Polygon.

‚öìÔ∏è üçπ **Together**, with a **strategic partnership** between both DAOs we are able to leverage talent, resources and community on both sides to meet our **unified vision** of creating best-in-class, exciting structured products for all participants in the market, whether you are a Frog Nation maxi or 99% stablecoin portfolio weighted yield farmer, there will be a product in the **Galleon<>Beverage** ship cargo hold for you.
