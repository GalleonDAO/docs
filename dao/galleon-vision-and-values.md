# ⚓ Galleon Vision and Values

## Through the Telescope :telescope:

****

Galleon DAO is a [**Set Protocol**](https://www.tokensets.com) **** ecosystem project founded by [Andrew from Set](https://twitter.com/andrew\_eth). With his experience working and collaborating with Set since the first version iteration of the protocol, two key opportunities have been identified in the sea of on-chain structured products — an ecosystem poised for exponential growth in 2022 and beyond.

{% hint style="info" %}
Galleon DAO is taking a **‘Scalable EVM first’** strategy where our focus is aligned with Ethereums scaling solutions and significantly growing EVM based networks.

### **Guild of Index Methodologists** <a href="#a8f0" id="a8f0"></a>

At present, the infrastructure laid down by Set enables scaled, fully composable, 100% collateralised structured products to be built. However, there has been a distinct lack of reliable strategy creators and implementors that are comfortable developing and managing index products in light of regulatory uncertainty, liquidity and funding.

{% hint style="success" %}
Galleon looks to create a guild of methodologists with the aim to **** research, curate, nurture a pipeline of products to be developed in-house or alongside Set ecosystem partners (e.g. [our partnership with Beverage Finance](https://blog.galleon.community/beverage-galleon-partnership-announcement-%EF%B8%8F-648e1743cac9)) whilst also having the advantage of a methodologist token to bootstrap growth and liquidity via incentives.

### **Distribution platform aligned with protocol growth** <a href="#7c03" id="7c03"></a>

Distributing structured products through decentralised exchanges is excellent in increasing your product’s reach and total holders, but are you growing? The way products built on Set Protocol work is that value can only be locked and unlocked via an [**issue and redemption process**](https://docs.tokensets.com/investors/issue-and-redeem-sets); once the Set is minted, it can be swapped and treated just like a standard ERC-20 token, but no more value is locked past that point. The problem statement here is that once you hit a certain level of product liquidity, growth tends to stagnate as incentives to issue the product decline.

{% hint style="success" %}
Galleon looks to own a DAO owned **** distribution platform, specifically to promote structured products in the Set ecosystem and taping into growth loops by incentivising the issuance of these products, increasing DAO TVL and revenue.&#x20;

## Our Values Aboard the Vessel :sailboat:

### Act with conviction

Seize opportunities within the DeFi space, partner and move aggressively to capture mindshare. Experiment freely, fear not to fail - fail fast, learn and adapt to succeed next time.

### Community-focused, governance minimised

The Galleon DAO community remains at the core of the project, however, governance is minimised to allow us to uphold our first value of acting with conviction and speed.

### Hold 17th-century roleplay to equal value

Galleon DAO is based around the 17th-century golden age of piracy. If you are not acting as a Spanish galleon merchant trader, Navy privateer or Pirate deckhand from Tortuga then you are not participating in the correct manner.
