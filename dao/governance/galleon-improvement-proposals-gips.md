# Galleon Improvement Proposals (GIPs)

GIPs are the main process by which the community of DOUBLOON holders can make changes to Galleon DAO.

With our Optimistic Governance model, previous Draft / Last Call stages of a standard Governance model are bypassed. See more details [here](https://court.galleon.community/c/used-for-formal-discussion-around-proposals-that-could-be-taken-to-an-on-chain-vote/9). Improvement Proposals are move through the following stages:

* **Draft** - an GIP that is open for consideration and is undergoing rapid iteration and changes. It should have an open forum discussion on [court.galleon.community](https://court.galleon.community) Proposals require 500k DOUBLOON voting power (can be delegated) to raise a GIP.
* **Last Call** - an GIP that is done with its initial iteration and fully specified. At this point, a GIP is assigned a number, discord channel created and ready for Snapshot. Snapshot is queued in 48 hours. All Snapshots are raised by the core team.
* **Accepted** - an GIP that has passed snapshot. This is when there is no objection to the vote, the snapshot passes and the proposal is executed by the team.&#x20;
* **Rejected** - an GIP that has failed to pass snapshot with 5% of supply objecting to the vote the proposed. If the proposal gets vetoed, it may only be re-proposed once amended from the original after discussion on [court.galleon.community](https://court.galleon.community) (48 hour minimum period).
* **Final** - an GIP that has been proposed on-chain and succeeded
* **Failed** - an GIP that has failed a snapshot or on-chain vote

Once a proposal reaches Final or Failed, any related threads and channels will be archived.

Snapshot delegation can be found [here](https://snapshot.org/#/delegate/galleondao.eth).

### Brethren Court

Add your GIP draft to proposals using the following format:

**Summary:** A simple description of the proposal's end result and desired change; should be no more than a few succinct sentences.

**Abstract:** Clearly describe how the proposal wishes to change/improve the protocol.

**Motivation:** Explain why this proposal is necessary or useful for the protocol.

**Specification:** A detailed description of parameters, implementation steps, any requested resources from the DAO, and a clear development plan

### Snapshot

Once a proposal reaches the Last Call stage and has been there for at least 2 days, a proposal can be sent for a Snapshot Vote. Snapshot votes are non-binding and should have clear propositions. Quorum to move to Approved status is 1M DOUBLOON. Including options for "no" and "more discussions" is recommended.

### **On-Chain Proposals**

To make an on-chain proposal you require at least 50,000 delegated DOUBLOON. Proposals need to be developed and reviewed by the Galleon DAO team before being put up for a vote.&#x20;

Snapshot votes are deployed by Admins, once the discussion has been finalised on discourse.
