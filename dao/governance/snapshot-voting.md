# Snapshot Voting

### What are Snapshot votes?

Snapshot voting is a way to vote off-chain without spending any ETH to signal support for a given proposal or path forward for a DAO vote.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Snapshot votes are NOT binding, all on-chain proposals must pass through the [Galleon DAO](galleon-dao.md)
{% endhint %}

Snapshot votes can calculate voting power at a certain point in time (block) and customized token balances, including delegations or tokens held in staked LP tokens, for example.

### How to Vote

1. Head to [https://vote.galleon.community/](https://vote.galleon.community/#/)
2. Click on “**Connect wallet**” button in the top right corner.
3. Connect with wallet provider where you hold DOUBLOON.
4. Select the active proposal you wish to vote on
5. After reading the proposal, select your preferred choice and "vote"
6. Your wallet will prompt you to sign a message, this does not cost any ETH and will submit your vote.

### How Voting weight is calculated

Voting weight is equal to the sum of your delegated, held, and staked DOUBLOON. For held DOUBLOON, if it is delegated, then it is not double-counted.

For staked DOUBLOON-ETH LP, only the DOUBLOON portion is counted and the unclaimed DOUBLOON does not count.

### How to make a proposal

Currently, only Admins can make a proposal, once approved on discourse.
