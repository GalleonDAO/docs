# Galleon DAO

A core principle of Galleon DAO is its fully decentralized design and minimal dependence on any centralized assets or protocols on Arbitrum. Galleon has been a from the start. The DAO is responsible for utilizing all of the flexible and powerful features of Galleon to continually enhance our offering and structure products in an ever-evolving DeFi space.&#x20;

### Responsibilities

Galleon DAO optimistic governance design and implementation minimizes the required governance for activities: testing and launching new products at a pace that is in-line with the market. Beyond the inherent need for the initial protocol tuning, the Galleon DAO is primarily responsible for two things: new products and incentivization's.

Product creation and Incentivisation's that Galleon DAO can make:

* grant/revoke [roles](https://www.notion.so/galleon/Full-Time-Opportunities-Public-66b96f2244bd4939b56e8d2f23c3d9d3)
* update product liquidity parameters
* adjust rewards from future staking pools
* upgrade products and other contracts throughout the DAO

### Design

The Galleon DAO Snapshot Parameters:

* Snapshot votes can only be raised by Core Team initially (in the future Galleon plans to add trusted community partners as well)
* 5% Veto Threshold&#x20;
* 48 hour voting period

Ultimately Galleon DAO as a community makes all of these decisions as the project evolves.
