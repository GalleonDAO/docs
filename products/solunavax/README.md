## Overview

The **SOLUNAVAX Index** is an ERC-20 **** structured product built natively on the **Optimism** network to enable traders to gain spot exposure to the enormously popular, alternate Layer 1 assets, Solana **(**[**SOL**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana)**),** Terra **(**[**LUNA**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/terra-luna)**)** and Avalanche **(**[**AVAX**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/avalanche)**)** using perpetual products. This is a first in the Set Protocol ecosystem for creating a **cross-chain strategy** and utilising the new, innovative [**Perpetual Protocol V2**](https://perp.com) **** integration.&#x20;

SOLUNAVAX takes full advantage of [**Optimism**](https://www.optimism.io) to provide significantly **cheaper and faster** transactions to traders, with the SOLUNAVAX Index, you are able to **invest into the three strongest L1 communities** after Ethereum in one click. At the same time, a novel mechanic of using perpetual contracts is that when the funding of the underlying positions is negative, **youâ€™ll be getting paid for the pleasure of holding the index.**

The **SOLUNAVAX Index** was built as a partnership product aiming to give traders unique exposure to narratives that are frequently highlighted and discussed by DeFi natives and communities whilst tokenising that position on-chain, **allowing it to be traded, lent, borrowed, bridged and integrated with the wider DeFi ecosystem.**

## Understanding the Methodology

The **SOLUNAVAX Index** follows a strict methodology prescribed by Galleon DAO & Beverage Finance. It is comprised of **three single perpetual 1x positions wrapped in Sets**, also created by Galleon & Beverage, to give **maximum flexibility** between gaining exposure to the entire theme or individual components. Our 1x perpetual tokens **cannot get liquidated** and are a novel ETH-native synth token that can be put in Curve pools, traded on exchanges and bridged.

You can buy the **SOLUNAVAX Index** on Optimism through:

* [Uniswap V3 **SOLUNAVAX/WETH** pool.](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=ETH\&outputCurrency=0xbA6a2Fa321BB06D668c5192Be77428106c5C01E5\&chain=optimism)
* [**TokenSets**](https://www.tokensets.com/v2/set/optimism/0xbA6a2Fa321BB06D668c5192Be77428106c5C01E5) (for non-U.S. users) as the first featured Set on the platform.



## How to Mint SOLUNAVAX

Uniswap V3 is a fantastic platform to buy the SOLUNAVAX Index, but what if the price of the liquidity pool increases away from the fair NAV of SOLUNAVAX due to demand?&#x20;

Well, there's a solution for that - **issuance.**

Issue SOLUNAVAX through our flash issuance contracts in one click through **SetSwap**

Alternatively, through **TokenSets** you can use USDC to issue the underlying components of SOLUNAVAX and then subsequently use the underlying components to issue SOLUNAVAX itself.&#x20;

### Prerequisites

* Connected to the **Optimism** network
* Have **USDC** in your wallet on Optimism

**The Following example assumes $10,000 USDC held**

### Issuing the underlying components (SOL1X, LUNA1X, AVAX1X)

Navigate and connect to the following TokenSets pages that represent SOLUNAVAXs underlying assets.

1. **SOL1X -** [https://www.tokensets.com/v2/set/optimism/0x95FFfb13856D2BE739a862f9b645573e5C838bdD](https://www.tokensets.com/v2/set/optimism/0x95FFfb13856D2BE739a862f9b645573e5C838bdD)
2. **LUNA1X -** [https://www.tokensets.com/v2/set/optimism/0x19F0622903A977A24bB47521732E6291002a4edE](https://www.tokensets.com/v2/set/optimism/0x19F0622903A977A24bB47521732E6291002a4edE)
3. **AVAX1X -** [https://www.tokensets.com/v2/set/optimism/0x522439fB1Da6DB24f18baAB1782486B55FE3A7b6](https://www.tokensets.com/v2/set/optimism/0x522439fB1Da6DB24f18baAB1782486B55FE3A7b6)

Click on the dropdown on the top right hand side and click the issue button - this is the process of providing USDC and in return minting the equivalent amount of SOL1X, LUNA1X or AVAX1X Sets.

Because SOLUNAVAX requires a **1:1:1 ratio of SOL1X, LUNA1X & AVAX1X** we want to split our **$10,000** and issue roughly **$3300** of each component. In this case, we required **38.32 Sets to equal 3300 USDC.**

Press the issue button and confirm the transaction to issue your Sets and repeat the process for each component (SOL1X, LUNA1X, AVAX1X).

Now you have the underlying components required to issue SOLUNAVAX, navigate to the following SOLUNAVAX TokenSets page to begin the process

In the same process as before, head over to the issue window for SOLUNAVAX and now, having the required underlying assets, just press the **MAX button** to calculate the total amount of SOLUNAVAX that can be issued based on your holders - proceed to press the issue button and confirm the transaction once you are happy.
