In this section, weâ€™ll be covering a guide for those who want to **issue ETHMAXY** either in scale for their own holdings or want to help Galleon DAO provision the product base Uniswap V3 DEX liquidity, enjoying **leveraged yield and capturing our lucrative incentive scheme** for creating a healthy market.

The process involves a bit of repetition as we repeatedly mint **ETHMAXY** using **aSTETH**, returning **ETHMAXY** and **WETH**, which represents a debt that is being taken on, that can be swapped to more stETH and repeated. Itâ€™s worth noting that when you want to sell you can just sell ETHMAXY through the V3 pool, there is no need to go through a redemption process unless our concentrated V3 liquidity cannot facilitate the trade.

_**Note:** As a small incentive on top of our LP rewards we will cover gas fees up to 2.5% of the minted position e.g. $20,000 of ETHMAXY minted, we will cover up to $500 of your gas fees for LPing_

#### **Step 1**

Own **stETH**, an easy way is using 1inch for direct swapping into stETH on Lido from any asset (routed through ETH).

#### **Step 2**

Deposit **stETH** into **Aave**. We need to do this because **aSTETH** is the entry point asset for **ETHMAXY** issuance.

#### **Step 3**

Issue **ETHMAXY** on the following **TokenSets** page

[**TokenSets - Asset Management Simplified**](https://www.tokensets.com/v2/set/0x0fe20e0fa9c78278702b05c333cc000034bb69e2)

* Connect your wallet
* Click the dropdown menu next to the â€˜Sellâ€™ button and click â€˜Issueâ€™
* Approve spending of your **aSTETH**
* Click â€˜Maxâ€™ and issue your **ETHMAXY**

_**(Optional)** You will receive **ETHMAXY** & **WETH**. You can optionally use this **WETH** to trade into more **stETH** and repeat steps 1â€“3 to fully wind up a full **ETHMAXY** position, transaction fees are the only thing to keep in mind. The simplicity in this product comes from people being able to trade into the liquid asset for max exposure without any of this issuance process (which is why we want to reward LP)._

**Step 4**

Create your LP position on our **ETHMAXY/WETH G-UNI Pool** on Sorbet Finance.

* Approve **ETHMAXY & WETH**
* Deposit all your **ETHMAXY** into the pool and the small ETH requirement
* Receive **G-UNI Pool** tokens

Our liquidity is concentrated on Uniswap V3 within a \[-1%, 10%] range above the **ETH** price (**ETHMAXY** should only appreciate vs **ETH** due to yields).

#### **Step 5**

Stake your **G-UNI LP** tokens on SetSwap below on our **ETHMAXY** page and earn $**DRINK** & $**DBL** dual rewards.

You will see your **$DRINK** rewards go up periodically at launch, we are also following up with **$DBL** rewards on **14/03/2022** as a dual incentive scheme and reward for LPs for our new flagship product. Enjoy!
