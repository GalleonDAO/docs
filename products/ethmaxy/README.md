**Galleon DAO & Beverage Finance** are excited to announce the launch of our second collaborative, fully composable, mainnet product, the **ETH Max Yield Index** ($ETHMAXY).

## **ETH Max Yield Index ($ETHMAXY)**

The ETH Max Yield Index is a new structured product built natively on the **Ethereum** network to enable traders to gain 3x+ leveraged staked **ETH** yield exposure via **stETH**, through Lido and Aave.

This product was made possible through the successful pass of stETH being added to **Aave**: [https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-add-support-for-steth-lido/2123/14](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-add-support-for-steth-lido/2123/14)

**Galleon DAO & Beverage Finance** are taking no prisoners to the brig, the **ETH Max Yield Index** is our first structured product released on mainnet targeting the large capital pools that exist on Ethereum that are seeking to put their assets to work. **ETHMAXY** provides a **3x+ stETH** levered position using ETH as the debt asset. In a representative example, if **stETH** is paying 5% staking APY while the borrowing rate for ETH is <1%, **ETHMAXY** would achieve **13â€“15% APY,** the highest ETH APY rates seen in DeFi whilst maintaining full composability and simplicity of a regular ERC20 token. Choose to enter and exit your position with a single swap on **Uniswap,** **itâ€™s that easy.**

The **ETH Max Yield Index** was built as a partnership product aiming to give DeFi natives the most yield possible on their staked ETH in addition to acting as a best-in-class **treasury diversification asset** for DAOs looking to **maximise the productivity of their idle ETH.**

**Interested in an asset like this for your DAO treasury?** Reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/galleondao), we would be happy to guide you through the process for minting in larger quantities and pay any transaction fees accrued to do so.

## Understanding the Methodology

The Ethereum Max Yield **** Index follows a strict methodology, it is composed of stETH, deposited as collateral, allowing ETH to be borrowed and wrapped into stETHâ€Šâ€”â€Šthis process is repeated until the token is 3x+ levered. Aave LTV for stETH is 70% and liquidation is at 75% which means stETH can be looped 3.33xâ€Šâ€”â€Š4x.

### **Product parameters**

* **Underlying Asset:** stETH (collateral), ETH (debt asset).
* **Rebalance Interval**: No fixed interval. The product will be rebalanced if the leverage ratio falls due to stETH APY accrued.
* **Streaming Fee: 1.95**%
